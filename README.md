First make sure that JavaFX is successfully installed and usable on your IDE
To run the game, load source into an ide, and then run GameGUIManager. Once this is done, change the vm options to:
"--module-path "libarypath" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
With "libarypath" being the path to your javaFX libary. Once this is done run GameGuiManager again, and enjoy!
